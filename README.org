* nEXT Browser
nEXT is the fastest productivity browser. nEXT is a keyboard-oriented,
extensible web-browser inspired by Emacs and designed for power
users. The application has familiar key-bindings, is fully
configurable and extensible in Lisp, and has powerful features for
productive professionals. nEXT Browser is the infinitely EXTensible
browser.

* Powerful Features
** Fast tab switching
Switch easily between your open tabs by fuzzy search. If you are
looking for ~http://www.example.com~, you could type in ~ele~, ~exa~,
~epl~, and any other valid series of letters. In a future release,
typing any semantically related word will give you a fuzzy search of
your open tabs and let you quickly find which page you were looking
for.

** History as a tree
History is represented as a tree that you can traverse. More complex
than the "forwards-backwards" abstraction found in other browsers,
the tree makes sure you never lose track of where you've been.

In the example below, the User performs the following actions:

1. Starts page ~Fish~
2. Visits page ~Amphibian~
3. Returns to page ~Fish~
4. Visits page ~Reptile~
5. Returns to page ~Fish~
6. Executes ~forwards~ keybind in history

It is at this point that a normal browser would NOT be able to
navigate you forwards to your visit of ~Amphibian~. Instead of
erasing your history, nEXT offers smart navigation and prompts the
user. Do you wish to go forwards to ~Amphibian~ or to
~Reptile~?

** Lightning fast navigation
nEXT is lightweight and fast. The interface does not get in your way,
and everything can be done by keyboard. You are free to fully focus on
your task unburdened by cumbersome UI.

Link Hints provide you with the ability to instantly jump to any link
on the page, or even open it in a new tab.

Fuzzy completion means intelligent completion. Find your bookmarks,
open up new links, or switch tabs with the power of fuzzy completion.
